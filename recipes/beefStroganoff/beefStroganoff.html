        <li>Crush in 1 garlic clove and cook for 2-3 mins more, then add 1 tbsp butter.</li>
        <li>Once the butter is foaming a little, add 250g sliced mushrooms and cook for around 5 mins until completely softened.</li>
        <li>Season everything well, then tip onto a plate.</li>

        <li>Add the steak pieces to the pan, splashing in a little oil if the pan looks dry, and fry for 3-4 mins, until well coloured.</li>
        <li>Tip the onions and mushrooms back into the pan. Whisk 150g crème fraîche, 1 tsp English mustard and 100ml beef stock together, then stir into the pan.</li>
